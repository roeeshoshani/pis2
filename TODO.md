# TODO
notes about stuff that needs to be done.

- handle prefixes: REP* prefixes, LOCK prefix, segment override prefixes
- mips zero register, is it an actual register or just returns zero? can it be written to?
- do i always run the delay slot insn in conditional branch? i remember some edge case with this... check it.
